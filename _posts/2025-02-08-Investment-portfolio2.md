# Bloomberg Back Testing

## **Equity Screening**
- Back test via the “Equity Screening” function (EQS)
- ![Bloomberg Interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xierangu00/xierangu00.github.io/main/bloomberg.png)

### Long
- Buy shares (assume no initial short position)
  - 这里的initial Short position 指的是你需要先买回股票以覆盖空头，然后再持多头
- This means you own these shares
- If the stock price goes up, you will benefit.
  - The idea is pretty simple, you buy at one price and hope to sell at a higher price in the future for a profit
