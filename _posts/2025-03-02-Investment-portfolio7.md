# Bloomberg Relative Rotation Graph

## Bloomberg Relative Rotation Graph (RRG) Overview
- The Bloomberg RRG is a visual tool used in technical analysis that helps in identifying the **relative strength and momentum of securities** against a benchmark or a group of securities. 
- This graph is particularly useful in asset management for:
  - Predicting stocks that might outperform which are not directly linked to traditional quant factors like value or momentum.
  - Assisting in sector rotation strategies by identifying promising sectors.
  - Determining optimal timing for entry points in different securities or sectors.

## Explanation of RRG Components
![Graph](RRG.png)
- X-axis (Relative Strength Ratio): 
  - Measures the performance of a stock relative to a benchmark. 
  - The further to the right on the axis, the more a stock is outperforming its benchmark.
- Y-axis (Momentum of Relative Strength): 
  - Indicates whether the stock's relative strength is increasing or decreasing. 
  - A higher position on this axis suggests that the stock's outperformance against the benchmark is growing.


## Interpretation of the RRG Quadrants
![Graph](quadrant.png)
- **Leading (Quadrant 2)**: Stocks are outperforming the benchmark and the degree of outperformance is increasing.
- **Weakening (Quadrant 4)**: Stocks are still outperforming the benchmark but the rate of outperformance is decreasing.
- **Lagging (Quadrant 3)**: Stocks are underperforming the benchmark with no signs of improvement.
- **Improving (Quadrant 1)**: Stocks are underperforming the benchmark but are showing signs of improvement.

The common movement across these quadrants is generally **clockwise**, which suggests a typical cycle a stock might follow **from outperforming to underperforming and back**.
- E.g., from 2 to 4 to 3 to 1 to 2

### another way of interpretation
- **Quadrant 1 - “shopping list”**
  - This quadrant typically includes stocks that have not yet met the market benchmark but are showing improvement. These stocks may not be fully recognized by the market, making this a good area for investors looking for potentially undervalued investment opportunities.
- **Quadrant 2 – current leaders, but be wary of signs of weakness**
  - This quadrant includes stocks that are currently performing well relative to the benchmark. While these stocks may be showing strong performance now, investors should watch closely for any signs that their relative performance advantage is diminishing.
- **Quadrant 4 - The bottom right – had good momentum, but rolling over**
  - Stocks in this quadrant might have performed well recently but are now showing a decline in performance. This could be due to various factors such as deteriorating fundamentals or changes in market sentiment.
- **Quadrant 3 - The bottom left – too early to buy**
  - Stocks in this quadrant are performing poorly and show no signs of improvement. These stocks might need more time to recover, or they might not be good investment choices at all.



## Additional Notes on the Use of RRG
- Sector Analysis: RRG can help identify which sectors are gaining strength and which are losing it, aiding in decisions about sector rotation.
- Individual Security Analysis: Using Bloomberg’s **EQS (Equity Screening) function**:
  1. Create a screen that filters out constituents of the S&P 500.
  2. Add another filter based on specific characteristics to narrow down the list to 10-15 stocks.
  3. DO NOT backtesting but instead opt to "See Results" for a more real-time assessment.
  4. Export this list of stocks to analyze with the RRG.

## Practical Application
By importing this curated list into the RRG, investors can visually assess which stocks are currently leaders (suggesting a potential hold or careful watch for signs of peaking) and which are in the improving phase (potential buys if they continue to gain strength). This graphical analysis helps in avoiding stocks that are starting to lag or are already weak, thus enhancing the decision-making process in portfolio management.

## Summary
The Bloomberg RRG is a powerful tool for dynamic sector rotation and stock analysis, providing insights that are not solely based on quantitative metrics but also on how stocks are performing relative to each other over time. This approach is especially valuable in volatile markets where traditional metrics may not fully capture a stock's potential or risks.
