# **Introduction to M&A investments**

## **Investment paths for growth**

* Goal: Maximize firm value
* Sometimes this involves growing
  * Build a new plant
  * Buy another firm
  * Produce a new product
* Two types of growth paths: organic and inorganic
* Involving different entry points: core market, adjacent market, or new market

## **Organic growth: pros and cons**


| Advantages for Organic Growth                    | Disadvantages for Organic Growth |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Less expensive than inorganic growth             | Can be very slow                 |
| Less risky than inorganic growth (typically)     | Growth may be limited            |
| Can be better planned for                        |                                  |
| Easier to control                                |                                  |
| Maintains existing culture and management styles |                                  |

## **Inorganic growth via M&A**

* Inorganic growth is when firms join via an M&A or an alliance
* Mergers and acquisitions (M&As): two businesses combine in some manner
* Bidder (or acquirer): initiator of the transaction
* Target: opposite side of the transaction

## **Inorganic growth: pros and cons**


| Advantages of inorganic growth ***                                     | **Disadvantages of inorganic growth**                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can occur more quickly than organic growth                             | More expensive than organic growth                                    |
| Firms can benefit from a greater pool of skills and experience         | Difficult to combine different organizational cultures and management |
| Customers, sales, assets, and market position are acquired immediately | Possibilities of diseconomies of scale                                |
| Reduces competition                                                    | Greater risk (typically)                                              |
|                                                                        | Difficult to control                                                  |

## **Types of M&A activity**

* There are a variety of ways to classify M&A activities
* The two most common ways to classify are based on:

  1. How the companies physically come together

  - Forms of integration

  2. How the companies’ business activities relate to one another

  - Types of mergers

## **Types of mergers: Synergistic**

* Synergistic mergers
  * Occur when the combined company will be worth more than the two companies would be worth if operating separately
  * Typically, synergy results from reducing costs or increasing revenues
* Cost synergies
  * Common rationale for mergers in the same industry
  * Exists because of economies of scale
  * Idea: the new firm would have very similar operations but lower costs by reducing redundant work
* Revenue synergies
  * Created by cross-selling products, increasing market penetration, or raising prices to take advantage of reduced competition
* Example: US Airways + American Airlines

## **Synergies and integration**

* Many M&As involve vertical integration
  * Backward vertical integration: A firm takes over a supplier
    * For example, an oil transporter buys an oil exploration and production company
  * Forward vertical integration: A firm takes over a customer
    * For example, an oil transporter buys a set of gasoline stations
* Example: ExxonMobil became a fully vertically integrated firm via M&A
* Does vertical integration yield cost synergies? Revenue synergies?

## **Do mergers work?**

* M&As don’t always achieve anticipated synergies!
* Firms often underestimate one-time costs
* Cost savings often take longer to materialize and are less sustainable than projected to be
* We’ll look at market data later when we cover M&A financing
  * As well as add more terminology and institutional details

## **Types of mergers: Conglomerates**

* Conglomerate mergers
  * Occur when two companies operate in completely separate industries (and so are not expected to have many synergies)
* Why do this?
  * Managers may cite the need to diversify the firm’s cash flows
  * However, this makes no sense for shareholders of public firms unless there are substantial market frictions!
    * Why? For public firms, investors can diversify at far lower cost and with more ease than the firm itself
    * For private firms, there may be benefits, if substantial frictions affect investors
* Examples: GE, Honeywell, 3M, Fortune Brands, United Technologies, Cargill, Time Warner, Altria Group, Berkshire Hathaway

## **Does conglomeration increase value?**

* Earlier research: newly formed conglomerates in the US typically price at a 15% discount relative to other firms
  * This finding led US public firms to focus on their “core competencies”
* Recent research: newly formed conglomerates price at no discount relative to when they were stand-alone firms
  * What might drive the difference in findings?
* **Bottom line**: The effect of conglomeration on value remains controversial and unclear

# **Introduction to M&A valuation**

## **Using DCF to value a target company**

* We can use DCF analysis in the M&A context, in a way similar to the NPV approach used to evaluate investment projects
  1. Determine the expected cash flows
  2. Discount cash flows back to the present at the appropriate discount rate
* Steps for DCF analysis
  1. Determine a free cash flow model to use (e.g., cash flows during a high growth phase or a stable growth phase)
  2. Develop pro forma financial estimates (i.e., estimates of future values)
  3. Calculate free cash flows using the pro forma data
  4. Discount free cash flows to the present
  5. Determine the terminal value and discount it to the present
  6. Add the discounted free cash flows and the discounted terminal value to get the value of the target firm

## **Example: DCF to value a target company**

* Citysearch is considering acquiring Urbanspoon
* Citysearch’s analysts have
  * developed a DCF model that is appropriate for their analysis
  * developed the pro forma financials for Urbanspoon (next slide)
* Assume the post-merger WACC is 9.50%
* Calculate Urbanspoon’s free cash flows and estimate Urbanspoon’s value as of January 2009 using DCF analysis

## **Steps 1 & 2: Pro forma financials**

- ![Step](Proformafinancials.png)

## **Steps 3 & 4: Calculate and discount FCFs**

- ![Step](DCF.png)

## **Steps 5 & 6: Terminal value and sum**

$$
Terminal value = \frac{FCF_5(1 + g)}{WACC - g} = \frac{1,293(1 + 6\%)}{9.5\% - 6\%}

$$

> - Terminal CFs: 39176.09
> - Discounted Terminal CFs: 24885.73
> - Sum Discounted Values: 29034.33

- Note: use adjusted-WACC throughout to discount cash flows
  - Unlike in evaluating investment projects (where the discount rate is just the WACC)
  - When we are evaluating a potential merger target, we want to adjust the target’s WACC to reflect any changes in the target’s risk or capital structure that may result from the merger
  - That is, adjusted WACC = post-merger WACC
- Target has value of ~$29 million

## **Comparable company analysis**

* Comparable company analysis
  * Uses relative valuation metrics for similar firms to evaluate market value
  * Then adds a takeover premium to determine a fair price for the acquirer to pay for the target
* Steps for comparable firm analysis
  1. Identify the set of comparable firms
  2. Choose scaling bases and calculate for comparables (e.g., P/E)
  3. Calculate the average or median for the selected ratio, and apply those to the target firm (e.g., value = EPS x P/E)
  4. Estimate a takeover premium
  5. Calculate the estimated takeover price for the target as the sum of the estimated stock value based on comparables and the takeover premium

> ## **Example: Comparable company analysis**
>
> - Suppose an analyst collected the following comparable company data
> - ![Example](ComComAna.png)
> - Estimate the price that should be paid to acquire AGSI using the P/B, P/S, and P/E ratios, as well as the relevant takeover premium
>
> ### **Steps 1, 2, & 3**
>
> - ![Example](Step.png)
> - **Step 1**: Calculate each multiple for each comparable firm, and average each multiple across the firms
>   > - ![Example](Step1.png)
> - **Step 2**: Multiply avg multiple x target firm financial
>   > - ![Example](Step2.png)
> - **Step 3**: Average the imputed prices across the multiple estimations
>   > - ![Example](Step3.png)
> - **Step 4**: Estimate a takeover premium; calculate the premium paid for each past transaction, then take the average
>   > - ![Example](Step4.png)
> - **Step 5**: Calculate the estimated takeover price for the target firm
>   > - Estimated takeover price = average imputed price x (1 + estimated takeover premium)
>   > - ![Example](Step5.png)
