# Introduction to leveraged buyouts

## Leveraged Buyouts
- A **leveraged buyout (LBO)** is the acquisition of another company using a significant amount of borrowed money to meet the cost of the acquisition.
- The assets of the company being acquired are often used as collateral for the loans, along with the assets of the acquiring company.
- The purpose of leveraged buyouts is to **allow companies to make large acquisitions** without having to commit a lot of capital.

- **Assumption**:
  - Heavy interest and principal payments will be made with cash from operations and/or asset sales after the purchase.

- **Investors pursuing the LBO generally hope**:
  - To reverse the LBO within **3-7 years**.
  - E.g., via **public offering** or sale of the company to another firm.

- **An LBO is likely to be successful only if**:
  - The firm generates enough cash to **serve the debt** in the early years.
  - The firm is **attractive to other buyers** as the buyout matures.

- **LBOs are common in the Private Equity (PE) space**:
  - PE firms are organized similarly to, and share many of the advantages of, venture capital firms.
  - One key difference is the **magnitudes invested** (PE’s are much larger).

- **LBO transaction volume in 2006–2007** (i.e., the peak of the PE market):
  - Total volume was around **$700 billion**.
  - **Average deal size** was **$250 million**.

## Deal Parties

- **Investor group**, typically private equity firm(s)
  - Approaches target management with a buyout proposal.

- **Investment banks**
  - Advise, provide, and underwrite financing.

- **Other lenders and bond investors**
  - Include commercial banks, insurance companies, pension funds, high-yield mutual funds, hedge funds.

- **Target management**
  - Responsible for negotiating buyout price on behalf of shareholders.
  - In **management buyouts (MBOs)**, management is part of the investor group.

## How Equity Investors Generate Returns

- **Grow firm value** by **improving management**.
- Use **asset sales or cash flows** of the firm to **pay off debt**.
- **Monetize equity stake** when they exit the investment: **via IPO or sale**.
- **Goal**: High return on investment.
- **Returns to equity** driven by:
  - Selling price at exit.
  - Equity share of selling price.


- Returns to Equity Driven By:
  - **Selling price** at exit.
  - **Equity share** of selling price.

- **Low capex, R&D requirement**.
- **Undermanaged or underused assets**.

## How LBOs Create Value

- **Tax shields** benefit of leverage.
- **Disciplinary role of debt**: agency costs of free cash flow.
- **Improve incentives**: larger/better compensation for management, increased equity stake.
- **Improve monitoring**: PE firms as **tough owners**.
- **For take-private LBOs**: avoid the costs of being a public company:
  - Compliance costs associated with **Sarbanes-Oxley**.
  - **Shareholder scrutiny**, pressure to meet short-term earnings.

## Example1 : KKR’s LBO of RJR Nabisco

- In **1988**, the price of **RJR stock** was **$55 per share**:
  - The firm had **$5 billion of debt**.
  - The firm’s **CEO and other senior managers** announced a bid of **$75 per share** to take the firm **private** in a **management buyout**.
  - Within days of management’s offer, **Kohlberg, Kravis, and Roberts (KKR)** entered with a **$90 bid** of their own.
  - By the end of November, **KKR emerged from the bidding process** with an offer of **$109 per share, or $25 billion total**.
- **RJR was the largest LBO in history until 2006**:
  - In **2006**, three private equity firms paid **$33 billion** for the acquisition of **Hospital Corporation of America (HCA)**.
  - This was also **a part KKR buyout**.

## Example2: KKR’s LBO of Safeway
- Safeway: #1 US national grocery chain
  - ![LBO](KKR1.png)
- Uncompetitive wage structure: largely unionized
  - ![LBO](KKR2.png)
- High-cost structure led to market share losses

  - Shareholders received ~80% premium
- $6.0B buyout, 79% financed by debt
  - $4.5B in new debt, including $1B of bonds underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert
  - Assumption of existing debt of $1.2B
- Needed to sell assets to pay off debt
  - Asset sales of $2.4B by 1988
  - Sold 1,000 of 2,400 stores, employing 74,000 people
- Leverage against unions to accept wage concessions
