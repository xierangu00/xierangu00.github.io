I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Finance at Emory University’s [Goizueta Business School](https://goizueta.emory.edu/). Before coming to Atlanta, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from [ESSEC Business School](https://www.essec.edu/en/) in July 2024.

I have a strong passion for finance and enjoy exploring the complexities of business strategy, investments, and risk management. My academic journey has given me a global perspective, with experiences in both France and US. I’m always eager to deepen my expertise and stay at the forefront of the evolving financial landscape.
